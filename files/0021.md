## What's this?

This year, we're proud to sponsor [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/). To commemorate this event, we're launching a month-long quest to direct everyone's attention on what matters most this October: _contributing to open source_. We're also organising some challenges to make this even more exciting.

### ðŸ’¥ Impact awards

This month we're sending some swag to the contributors that make the most _impact_ during Hacktoberfest. We will measure _impact_ using our own metrics and heuristics, such as [DevRank](https://docs.quira.sh/for-developers/devrank). Here's how to participate:

1. Check-in to [Quest #21](https://quira.sh/quests/creator/details?questId=21).
2. Do Hacktoberfest!
5. Submit a link to your GitHub README profile, for example `https://github.com/{username}/{username}`. Bonus points if you embed your [stats](https://quira.sh/stats) âœ¨

### ðŸ”‘ Access to Solver Quests

We are also partnering with several companies that are creating _Solver Quests_ on their repos. That's right - this October, you'll be able to finally access to _Solver Quests_. All you need to do is find an existig Solver Quest and loot it! Where can you find these Solver Quests? They're hidden on GitHub! The best thing you can do to find them is participating in Hacktoberfest and do your own thing... you might find them along the way. We'll might also drop a few hints along the way.
