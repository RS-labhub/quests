## What's this?

This year, we're proud to sponsor [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/). To commemorate this event, we're launching a month-long quest to direct everyone's attention on what matters most this October: _contributing to open source_. We're also organising some challenges to make this even more exciting.

### ðŸ’¥ Impact awards

This month we're sending some swag to the contributors that make the most _impact_ during Hacktoberfest. We will measure _impact_ using our own metrics and heuristics, such as [DevRank](https://docs.quira.sh/for-developers/devrank). Here's how to participate:

1. Check-in to [Quest #21](https://quira.sh/quests/creator/details?questId=21).
2. Participate in Hacktoberfest!
3. Submit a link to your GitHub README profile, for example `https://github.com/{YourUsername}/{YourUsername}`.

If you want to give your profile a glow up try embedding your [stats](https://quira.sh/stats) âœ¨

### ðŸŒŠ Some GitHub repos hosting solver quests

- [Taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)
- [Cyclops](https://github.com/cyclops-ui/cyclops)
- [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/)
- [MindsDB](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb)

More to be announced soon âœ¨

### ðŸ”‘ Access to Solver Quests

We are also partnering with several companies that are creating _Solver Quests_ on their repos. That's right - this October, you'll be able to finally access to _Solver Quests_. The key to access Solver Quests is to solve an existing Solver Quest! We've placed some already on GitHub and we'll continue to place a few here and there throughout Hacktoberfest. To find them just enjoy Hacktoberfest... you might find them along the way. If not, we'll drop a few hints in the next few days.
