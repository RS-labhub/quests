## **🐶 About Permit.io**

[permitio/opal](https://github.com/permitio/opal) helps with real-time data and configuration updates to authorization policies across applications - there are 2 main components in the repo: Policy engine (such as OPA or Cedar) and OPAL. Developers uses the engine to enforce policy and OPAL ensures policies and the data required to them are up-to-date.

You can think of permitio/opal like an automatic update system for a video game. Imagine you're playing a game where the rules change often---like what powers your character has or which areas you can explore. Not only that, users' data calculated in the policy decision--like how many levels this character passed--is dynamic. Instead of having to pause the game and download updates manually every time a change happens, OPAL automatically sends these updates to your game in real-time, and the policy engine (such as OPA) makes sure the task is executed. This way, you always have the latest game rules while you play, without interruptions.
