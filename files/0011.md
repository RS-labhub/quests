## **🧱 About AI Bloks**

AI Bloks is a no-code AI platform that integrates semantic & generative AI in a seamless business-driven workflow so enterprises can build evidence-based AI applications.

AI Bloks’s platform is built on top of [LLMware](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware) which is an open source project that provides a coherent, high-quality, integrated, and organised framework for building LLM applications for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

### 🤔 What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework in AI that improves the quality of LLM responses. This is done by improving the LLM’s internal representations by incorporating documents or other forms of data. RAG offers two main advantages:

1. You can serve the most up-to-date information, instead of relying on potentially outdated training data.
2. It reduces the likelihood of data leaks and errors in the model’s outputs (hallucinations).

Recently, RAG has seen a surge in popularity for applications that depend on knowledge bases and where responses with up-to-date data are needed. For example: 

- Handling support tickets by automating the answers to common inquiries.
- Searching through a business’s document database to create reports or analyses.

## 🌋 The Challenge

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to leverage LLMWare's capabilities to build something unique and potentially impactful that resonates with your passions or professional aspirations.

Some example projects people that we suggest are:

1. Develop an AI system for automated code quality checks and optimisation suggestions.
2. Build a voice-activated tool for managing team projects and tasks.
3. Implement a real-time, AI-powered customer support chatbot.
4. Develop a tool for automated financial analysis and reporting.
5. Build a compliance monitor for your preferred industry data to ensure security & regulatory adherence.

Be bold and creative! We want to see original apps 🤩

To get a head start you can read all about LLMWare’s [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware) and checkout their playlist [Fast Start to RAG video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW3fElxcri4&list=PL1-dn33KwsmD7SB9iSO6vx4ZLRAWea1DB).

### 🎖 About the RAG skill badge

In this Quest we’ll start awarding skill-related badges to participants that submit repos that are accepted by AI-Bloks.

Skill badges will help you prove that you have exposure or experience to specific technology or that you have displayed a particular skill in your open source code!

### 🏆 Requirements to be eligible for a prize

1. Your app must use AI-Bloks’s [LLMWare](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware).
2. Apart from submitting to Quine, submit your entry to this GitHub [folder via a PR.](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/Quest)
3. Please create a video (maximum 5 minutes long) to explain your project. Record the video, upload it to YouTube and embed/add the video/link in your README. The video should demonstrate your code in operation and showcase your project's functionality.
4. The content you submit to the quest must be original code.
5. You are allowed to generate code with LLMs and to use StackOverflow, but the app/repo idea must be yours and yours only. If we detect plagiarism from another repo or user, your submission will be removed from the quest.
6. The repo you submit must be submitted **on or after** the Quest’s **Start Date**. We will check the `created_at` stamps of all submitted repos to validate this and you will not be able to select a repo already on Quine.
7. Your project must have a README. Your README must clearly explain what the project does and how someone can run it or install it. Video demos are definitely helpful in helping the judges understand your project!
8. Teams **are not allowed** for this Quest.
9. Each team can only submit one repo. If you make a mistake, you have to remove the repo and upload a new one.
