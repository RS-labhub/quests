## üåã¬†The Challenge

The world is crazy about Co-pilots. They have taken the world by storm, revolutionising fields from software engineering to medicine and reshaping the way we interact with technology. CopilotKit has developed an open-source AI copilot platform that makes it extremely easy to integrate powerful copilots into your React apps. This Quest invites you to use CopilotKit to forge new, innovative copilots that not only assist but also inspire, educate, and entertain. 

Imagine context-aware in-app chatbots that execute actions within the app, AI-enhanced text fields offering context-sensitive autocomplete and insertions, or in-app AI agents that interact seamlessly with both your application and its users.

Some example projects people have built with CopilotKit are:

1. A [Text-to-PowerPoint app](https://dev.to/copilotkit/how-to-build-an-ai-powered-powerpoint-generator-langchain-copilotkit-openai-nextjs-4c76)
2. An [AI-powered spreadsheet app](https://dev.to/copilotkit/build-an-ai-powered-spreadsheet-app-nextjs-langchain-copilotkit-109d)
3. An [AI-powered blogging platform](https://dev.to/copilotkit/how-to-build-an-ai-powered-blogging-platform-nextjs-langchain-supabase-1hdp)
4. An app that lets you [chat with your resume](https://dev.to/copilotkit/how-to-build-the-with-nextjs-openai-1mhb)

And some ideas of what you could be building are:

1. An app that uses copilotkit to let users interact with Google maps in innovative ways.
2. An app that learns your tweeting style and suggests new tweets based on specific prompts.
3. An app that automatically writes and structures DevTo articles.
4. An app that scrapes Amazon to find products to buy‚Ä¶ or sell!
5. ‚Ä¶

Be bold and creative! We want to see weird and original apps ü§©

1. Your app must use CopilotKit.
2. The content you submit to the quest must be original code.
3. You are allowed to generate code with LLMs and to use StackOverflow, but the app/repo idea must be yours and yours only. If we detect plagiarism from another repo or user, your submission will be removed from the quest.
4. The repo you submit must be submitted **on or after** the Quest‚Äôs **Start Date**. We will check the `created_at` stamps of all submitted repos to validate this and you will not be able to select a repo already on Quine.
5. Your project must have a README. Your README must clearly explain what the project does and how someone can run it or install it. Video demos are definitely helpful in helping the judges understand your project!
6. Teams of at most 3 **are encouraged** for this Quest üôå.
7. Each team can only submit one repo. If you make a mistake, you have to remove the repo and upload a new one.
