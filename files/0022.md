## 🐻‍❄️ About MindsDB

[MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) is an open-source platform that helps developers build custom AI solutions with their data. Since its inception, MindsDB has actively supported Hacktoberfest and the open-source community. This October, MindsDB is introducing a special challenge that rewards both new and existing contributors with official MindsDB swag, and a prize draw of 3 Razor Blade 16 gaming laptops!  🧡

There are two tracks **👇**

### 1️⃣ Contribute to MindsDB

The first track consists of submitting valid PRs to any of MindsDB's Hacktoberfest [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest). Follow our [MindsDB’s Quira page](https://quira.sh/org/mindsdb) to see issues (to be posted on October 7th).

Types of issues include:

- Improve knowledge base integrations
- Improve integrations
- Fix bugs
- Perform testing

Here's how it works:

1. MindsDB will regularly update and tag new issues with the `hacktoberfest` label.
2. Issues are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. If you feel confident in tackling an issue, ask the maintainers to be assigned.
3. Once assigned, begin working on the issue. You are required to demonstrate significant progress every 24 hours, or the issue may be reassigned.
4. Points will be awarded according to MindsDB's Hacktoberfest points system, detailed at [https://mindsdb.com/hacktoberfest](https://mindsdb.com/hacktoberfest). Points are assigned in each issue.

### 2️⃣  Build an SDK and CLI for Minds

In the second track you’ll be challenged to build an SDK for MindsDB:

- Minds Golang SDK - [Issue #19](https://github.com/mindsdb/minds_python_sdk/issues/19)
- Minds Javascript SDK -  [Issue #18](https://github.com/mindsdb/minds_python_sdk/issues/18)
- Minds Ruby SDK - (Issue pending)
- Minds Rust SDK - (Issue pending)
- Minds C# SDK - (Issue pending)
- Minds Java SDK - (Issue pending)
- Minds CLI - (Issue pending)

Here’s how it works:

1. Create a new repository in your account and submit a Pull Request (PR) to this repository, adding the new SDK to the Other SDKs section of the README.
2. Submit the repository to this quest.
3. Multiple contributors are welcome, but the SDK with the highest standards—such as clear documentation, robust tests, and overall code quality—will be accepted.
4. Contributors will have ownership of the repository. 
5. The best SDK will be incorporated into MindsDB’s official repository. 

These submissions will adhere to the points-based system detailed at [https://mindsdb.com/hacktoberfest](https://mindsdb.com/hacktoberfest) and will be assigned points in the original issue.

### 🏆 Rewards
