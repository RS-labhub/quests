## About CopilotKit

[CopilotKit](https://www.copilotkit.ai/) is an open-source tool that makes it extremely easy to integrate AI copilots into your React apps. Imagine in-app context-aware chatbots, AI-enhanced text fields, or in-app AI agents that interact seamlessly with both your application and its users. Currently, CopilotKit is working on [Co-Agents](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents) a new product that provides infrastructure for connecting [LangGraph agents](https://www.langchain.com/agents) to humans in the loop.

## **⚔️ Tracks & Rewards**

We have three tracks available:

1. **Copilot track**: The challenge for the first track is to build new apps on top of CopilotKit. These apps should explore new use-cases, showcase specific features, or apply the technology to new domain areas. Submissions will be judged by originality, UI, and clarity. 
2. **Co-agent track**: The advanced track involves building new demos for CoAgents. This is a slightly more involved challenge that also requires some understanding of LangGraph. You can read more about CoAgents [here](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents).
3. **Design Track**: We will award a special prize for the best UI/UX valid submission on either track.
