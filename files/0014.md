## 💬 Your prompt

You are a competitive developer or indie hacker eager to accelerate the world's LLM-ification. You know at least a bit of SQL and Docker and are interested in applying LLMs to areas that have yet to benefit from AI. To achieve this, you plan to use MindsDB and open-source technologies. You're motivated by the prospect of winning a top prize, but more so by the opportunities for learning and creativity. You aim to hone your GenAI skills and collaborate with other talented creators. Your goal is to explore new ideas and enrich your public profile with impressive projects that might be useful in future job applications or even as a foundation for starting a business. Additionally, you're eager to earn a GenAI skills badge. While you're not sure of their exact value yet, you suspect they will become very useful soon. You're a responsible GitHub citizen, so you also plan to give [mindsdb/mindsdb](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb) a star on GitHub.

Use MindsDB, its powerful integrations, and its open source models to build an app that leverages LLM technology in an area that interests you.
