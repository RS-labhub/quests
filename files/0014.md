## 💬 Your prompt

You are a competitive developer or indie hacker eager to accelerate the world's LLM-ification. You know at least a bit of SQL and Docker and are interested in applying LLMs to areas that have yet to benefit from AI. To achieve this, you plan to use MindsDB and open-source technologies. You're motivated by the prospect of winning a top prize, but more so by the opportunities for learning and creativity. You aim to hone your GenAI skills and collaborate with other talented creators. Your goal is to explore new ideas and enrich your public profile with impressive projects that might be useful in future job applications or even as a foundation for starting a business. Additionally, you're eager to earn a GenAI skills badge. While you're not sure of their exact value yet, you suspect they will become very useful soon. You're a responsible GitHub citizen, so you also plan to give [mindsdb/mindsdb](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb) a star on GitHub.

Use MindsDB, its powerful integrations to build an app that leverages LLM technology to LLM-ify a something about the world.

## 🔀 Tracks

We have two tracks available, dependening on your level of experience:

### 🍚 Beginner track

Create a chatbot for [Slack](https://docs.mindsdb.com/use-cases/ai_workflow_automation/slack-chatbot), [Twitter](https://docs.mindsdb.com/use-cases/ai_workflow_automation/twitter-chatbot), or Discord!

Go the extra mile by exploring how your chatbot can facilitate new interactions in Slack or Discord servers. Additionally, consider expanding creating a chatbot to function on social media platforms beyond Twitter. For instance, could you develop a chatbot that mimics human interactions to promote products on Twitter? How about a chatbot that engages with comments on GitHub Issues or PRs?

### 🍣 Standard track

Any application that utilises niche or public datasets in conjunction with AI models is fair game. Some things MindsDB would be happy to see,
