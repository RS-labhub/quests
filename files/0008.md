## 🌋 The Challenge

The challenge for Quest 008 is to build an app that can help people have fun! That’s it…  it can be an app that makes people laugh, fosters better connections, or facilitates unforgettable experiences. Whether it's through immersive games, interactive challenges, or curated lists of fun things to do, just follow what you think would give you the most happiness. Some ideas:

1. An app that suggests weekend plans in your area.
2. A GenAI version of classic games like Pictionary, Scrabble, or Dungeons & Dragons.
3. An app that recommends dishes you can prepare with friends.
4. …

Be bold and creative! We're eager to see original, weird, and of course, fun apps 🤩
