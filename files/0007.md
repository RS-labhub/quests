## 🌋 The Challenge

The challenge for Quest 007 is to create a data-driven web application with [Taipy](https://www.taipy.io/).

Taipy is a new data & AI app builder for Python developers. It allows you to create data-driven applications even without any web development experience. While data analysis is a highly sought-after skill today, end-to-end creation of data-driven apps can be challenging due to the full-stack knowledge required that some data scientists may lack. Taipy enables data-scientists and data-oriented developers to concentrate more on the analysis and visualisation, and less on the app implementation.

We encourage you to build apps that allow you to extract value or new insights from data. If you need a dataset to work with you can find one [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). You can build,

- Apps that help you visualise [deforestation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=deforestation) or [climate change](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=climate+change),
- Apps that help you track or analyse financial assets like [cryptocurrencies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=cryptocurrency),
- Apps that help people explore [medical images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=medical+imaging) and find patterns in the data,
- Or anything you want!

If you need extra inspiration, check out Taipy’s [demos](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/knowledge_base/demos/). Just remember to be bold & creative. We want you to explore Taipy’s boundaries through a bold and creative idea!
