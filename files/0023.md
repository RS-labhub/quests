## About Daytona

Daytona is a radically simple open-source development environment manager. Over time, setting up development environments has become increasingly challenging, but this complexity is unnecessary. With Daytona, all you need to do is execute a single command: `daytona create`. As a developer, you can immediately focus on what matters most—your code.

## 🌋 The challenge

### 1️⃣ Challenge I: Create a sample for Daytona

| Start Date | End date | Prize pool |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| 3rd of December 2024 | **17th of December 2024** | $5,000 |

> 🚨 _**Projects for this phase are reviewed on an ongoing basis!**_

This track consists of creating a *sample project* for Daytona using the tech-stack of your preference. *Sample projects* are repositories that showcase how Daytona can be used with specific tech-stacks. Here’s what you have to do to unlock this, step by step 👇

1. Create a new repository from this template https://github.com/daytonaio/Sample-Template.
2. In this new repo, integrate Daytona into one of your previous projects (or build a new project if you prefer) and fill out the README as instructed in the template. The only restriction here is that the project must be your own - it can be a personal project, something you built for a Hackathon, or even a previous creator quest project.
3. Submit your repo to the Quest
4. The Quira team will review your project and if the prize pool hasn’t been depleted, we'll send you an email within 24 hours to confirm if the submission is valid. If it’s valid, we’ll send you instructions on how you can merge your sample repo into Daytona so you can claim the loot!

**The first 100 developers that complete this challenge will get a $50 reward 🔥**


### 2️⃣ Challenge II: Content & Tutorials

| Start Date | End date | Prize pool |
| --- | ---  | --- |
| 27th of November 2024 | 10th of January 2025 | $1,000 |

This challenge consists in creating content or tutorials that show others how you integrated Daytona in your projects or why you found it useful. There are two steps here:

1. Take the sample project you created for the Challenge I and either,
    1. Write an article to share your experience with the community.
    2. Create a new tutorial explaining how you used Daytona for one of your projects. Aim this tutorial at developers with a similar level of experience.

> 👀 Note that if you submitted a project to Challenge #1, you can add a link to your blogpost at any point before the quest ends by editing your submission.

This quest will follow a points-based system.

| Points | Rewarded if |

| 5 | Star https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/ |
| 50 | You created a valid Sample Project (it doesn’t matter if you didn’t loot Challenge 1!) |
| 45 | Awarded by judges based on the novelty, originality, and quality your submission. |

Reward structure:

| Reward | Rewarded to… |

| $10 | 11th place - 25th place |
| $50 | 3rd place - 10th place |
| $100 | 2nd place |
| $150 | 1st place |

Note that:

- A submission will be regarded valid if adheres to our [standard quest rules](https://docs.quira.sh/for-developers/quests/creator-quests/quest-standard-rules).
