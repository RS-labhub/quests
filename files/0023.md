## About Daytona

Daytona is a radically simple open-source development environment manager. Over time, setting up development environments has become increasingly challenging, but this complexity is unnecessary. With Daytona, all you need to do is execute a single command: `daytona create`. As a developer, you can immediately focus on what matters most‚Äîyour code.

## üåã¬†The challenge

The main goal of this challenge is to encourage you to try out Daytona and document your experience. It involves integrating Daytona into one of your projects, making contributions, and keeping a record of the process. We have four tracks:

**Track 1Ô∏è‚É£**: Spin up a Daytona development environment for one of your open source projects (you may use a repository from a previous creator quest). Add a section in the project‚Äôs README detailing how others can quickly get started and contribute to your project using Daytona.

**Track 2Ô∏è‚É£**: Use Daytona for your next Hackathon and write an article to share your experience with the community.

**Track 3Ô∏è‚É£**: Try Daytona the next time you‚Äôre reviewing a PR or contributing to open source, and write about your experience.

**Track 4Ô∏è‚É£**: Create a new tutorial explaining how you use Daytona for one of your projects. Aim this tutorial at developers with a similar level of experience.

We‚Äôre looking for concrete and tangible illustrations of how you integrate Daytona into your workflow.
