## 🌋 The Challenge

The internet is a vast and untamed ecosystem of data and websites. In this digital wilderness, Browserless emerges as a powerful tool that enables you to navigate its terrain and harness its resources 💎

The challenge for Quest 009 is to build an app that utilises the capabilities of Browserless to scrape websites, generate tests, or do QA testing! Some ideas:

1. An app that creates a virtual tour of your favourite website.
2. An app that generates traffic or monitors activity in one or more websites.
3. An app that compares content generated by two different sites.
4. …

Be bold and creative! We want to see weird and original apps 🤩
